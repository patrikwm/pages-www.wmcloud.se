From 12:44, there was an SMS delivery disturbance affecting +47/Telenor Norway subscribers. 13:56, Telenor reported that the issue was resolved. To mitigate the problem, starting 13:08 all OTPs to +47 numbers were delivered as inbox-SMS instead of the usual flash/pop-up. From 14:13, +47 traffic is back to flash/pop-up again as default.
