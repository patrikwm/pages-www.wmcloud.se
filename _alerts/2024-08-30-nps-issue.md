This affects customers using MS-CHAPv2 (not PAP). After the KB5040437 security upgrade, the RADIUS communication between MS NPS and Mideye stops working for older versions of the Mideye server (releases up to and including 6.4.2). The problem was initially addressed in Mideye server 6.4.3, but a complete fix is available in Mideye server 6.4.4. Until the Mideye server has been upgraded to version 6.4.4, customers are recommended to postpone deployment of KB5040437 in the NPS.
