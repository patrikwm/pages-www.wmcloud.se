title: Update Telenor Sweden SMS problems
date: 2023-01-23 10:30

Telenor still seems to have some consequential problems with the SMS-service affecting some users. For users that experience login problems due to SMS delays, we recommend the following:
- A phone re-start (power off – power on).
- Try activation of Mideye+: <a href="support/users/mideye/activate-mideye/">Instructions</a>
- In the phone settings -> Internet settings -> operator settings: try to change the preference between GSM/3G/4G/5G networks, as the problem seems to be related to which network generation the phone is using.

### Updated 2023-02-15 10:00

Telenor report that  approximately 5% of text messages sent to users of Telenor Sweden’s network between 10:45-20:36 CET during the incident 2023-01-20 were delivered to a different number than intended. For more information about the incident, see <a href="https://telenor.se/felskickade-sms">https://telenor.se/felskickade-sms</a>

During the incident, SMS-OTPs were not delivered within our required time window, but Mideye+ activations were in some cases successful (Mideye+ activation allows for SMS delays up to 5 minutes). For security reasons, Mideye+ apps that were activated during the incident have been revoked, and affected users have been informed.
