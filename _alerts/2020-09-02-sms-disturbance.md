title: SMS disturbance in +46/Sweden 2020-09-01 (Closed)

Starting 2020-09-01 11:14 there was a network disturbance affecting SMS-OTP deliveries to many +46/Sweden subscribers. Ordinary phone-to-phone SMS traffic was also affected. From 12:06, SMS-OTP service was back for the majority of affected users, but as a workaround OTP traffic to most +46/SE numbers (also those not affected by the original problem) was changed to inbox-SMS instead of the usual flash/pop-up. From 2020-09-02 10:30, all traffic is back to the original defaults with flash/pop-up. For any users still experiencing problems, a phone re-start is recommended. If this does not help, contact Mideye Support.
