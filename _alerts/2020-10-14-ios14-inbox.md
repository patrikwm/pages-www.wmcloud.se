title: Flash/pop-up SMS presented as inbox SMS in iOS 14
date: 2020-10-14

With iPhone iOS 14, flash/pop-up text messages are presented as ordinary inbox messages when the screen is locked. Users that are used to receiving flash/pop-up SMS-OTPs also when the screen is locked will notice a change when updating to iOS 14. This is a built-in behaviour in iOS and we are currently not aware of any workaround.
