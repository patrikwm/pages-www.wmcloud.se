					<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
					<p>The service you are trying to access is protected with Mideye authentication. To log in, you need
						a one-time password (OTP) which is sent to your mobile phone. Click <a title="Mideye tour"
							href="/the-tour/#/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to see&nbsp;the
						login procedure&nbsp;explained in a&nbsp;new window.</p>
					<p>The login fails if the phone does not acknowledge the reception of a one-time password within a
						pre-set time limit.</p>
					<p>Users with smartphones (Android, iPhone or Windows) that frequently experience OTP reception
						problems are recommended to activate Mideye+.</p>
					<p>Below, some frequest issues with OTP reception are listed.</p>

								<div class="entry-content">
									<p>OTP spamming / unsolicited one-time passwords can be caused by incorrectly
										registered user phone numbers, telephone problems or network caching/resending
										of old OTPs. Mobile subscribers that are not registered for any login service
										with one-time passwords (OTPs), but still receive Mideye OTPs to their phone,
										should contact <a href="mailto:helpdesk@mideye.com">helpdesk@mideye.com</a> to
										block OTP sending. Users with Android phones can experience reception of
										&#8216;extra&#8217; OTPs at odd times. These are actually old OTPs that have
										been cached in the phone operating system. Make sure to always select
										&#8216;Cancel&#8217; after reading an OTP. Occasional problems in the mobile
										network can sometimes cause caching and re-sending of old OTPs. Note that this
										is not something that should occur frequently, and does not have any security
										implication since Mideye OTPs have a limited life-time (default 60 seconds).</p>
