                    <p>Since its inception in 1999, Mideye has pioneered the area of strong user authentication based on
                        the mobile phone. The product, service and patent portfolio is focused on user login with the
                        phone as an additional layer of security. The Mideye authentication service can be applied to
                        any remote access service that requires secure user identification.</p>
                    <p>Mideye started as an innovation cell at Ericsson Radio Systems, and in June 2000 Mideye AB was
                        formed as a fully-owned subsidiary of Ericsson Business Innovation. Following a management
                        buy-out in July 2003, Mideye AB is today a privately held company. In 2016, Mideye acquired
                        Titansoft Oy, a spin-off of the Tectia MobileID business unit from SSH Communications Security.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mideye serves a global customer base comprising enterprises, government authorities and mobile
                        operators, with users in all inhabited continents. The company headquarters are located in
                        Stockholm, Sweden. The subsidiary Mideye Oy is based in Espoo, Finland.</p>
